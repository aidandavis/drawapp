# DrawApp

Sample Flutter Drawing App which allows the user to draw onto the canvas along with color picker and brush thickness slider.

All code free to use and located within [/lib](https://github.com/SnakeyHips/drawapp/tree/master/lib).

Special thanks to stackoverflow user Andrey Turkovsky for helping out with color per drawn line issue. 


## Now, connected to Firebase to allow anyone to view and edit at once
Firebase config files need to be downloaded to enable Firestore. Create a Firebase project and go through the FlutterFire steps to add the config to Android and iOS.

When the app starts, you can enter a 5-character room key to view an existing canvas, or create a new one.

### Future ideas
* Have a simple share intent to get the room key out there.
* Better UI.
